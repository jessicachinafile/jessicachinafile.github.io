1) All data related to temporary activities is stored in a Google Sheet with "Temporary Activities" in the title. Before you change anything in the Google Sheet, save a new version with today's date in the title (e.g. "Temporary Activities 2017-04-23").  Work in the new spreadsheet to add any new data.  This is so that there are older versions of the data available in case things accidentally get erased (which happens).
2) When you are ready to update the online sortable table, copy and paste all your data from the main tab in the spreadsheet to the tab called "ready to upload".  You can just paste over whatever's already in there (it's old data and we don't care about it anymore).  Working with your freshly-pasted-in data, delete the gray columns and anything else you don't want published online. 
3) Cut and paste this data pretty, cleaned-up data into http://tableizer.journalistopia.com/.  Make sure to click the "No CSS" box below the cut-and-paste field. Then click "Tableize it!".
3) Copy and paste the resulting html code into the appropriate file, between the lines that say !<--paste your new data below this line--> and !<--paste your new data above this line-->.  Paste in the new data over the old data that's already in there.
4) Go to the first line of html that you just pasted in.  Delete the following: "<table class="tableizer-table">"
5) Go into the appropriate node in the CMS (which we will add here once it's up), and change the "Last Updated" date to today's date.
